      <p>Hi! I'm Freddie Bell, <br> an ex-model and bartender moving into web development to find a career with a greater depth of learning where I can apply my love of technology.<br>
        I loved how fast paced and cutting edge the fashion industry was but after a few years I quickly realised my personal growth was starting to stagnate and I wasn’t learning new skills at the speed I’d like to. I’ve always had a naturally good grasp of tech and enjoy using it; after researching into the tech world I quickly realised that a career as a web developer was exactly what I was looking for.<br>
        Having thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student at General Assembly, I’m now looking for a job as a developer so I can have a dynamic career in an innovative industry AND be able to keep on refining my skills and learning new ones.

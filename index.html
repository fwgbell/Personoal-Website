      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="about-me">
        <p>Hi! I'm Freddie Bell</p>
        <p>An ex-model and bartender moving into web development to find a career with a greater depth of learning where I can apply my love of technology.</p>
        <p>I loved how fast paced and cutting edge the fashion industry was but after a few years I quickly realised my personal growth was starting to stagnate and I wasn’t learning new skills at the speed I’d like to. I’ve always had a naturally good grasp of tech and enjoy using it; after researching into the tech world I quickly realised that a career as a web developer was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
        <p>Wanting to fast track this career change I decided to take part in the web development immersive course offered at General Assembly. I loved how much content we were able to cover in a condensed amount time and was really happy to be back in an environment where we were encouraged to keep on improving our skills. I’m now looking for a job as a developer so I can have a dynamic career in an innovative industry AND be able to keep on refining these skills and learning new ones.

          <h2>Save The Pitch</h2>
          <p>The aim with Save the Pitch was to create an app that would get young people away from their screens and out onto the pitches, playgrounds and cages of inner city London.</p>
          <p>Through mapping and photographing these pitches I aimed to open them up to new players and make them inviting, attractive and accessible. I hoped to use technology to get people out there to join games and kick-abouts.</p>
          <p>This was my fourth and final project from my time at General Assembly, built on my own in just under a week. The application was made using an Express back-end and React front-end using several node modules such as leaflet and moment, to make the most of mapping and timings respectively.</p>

          <h2>Film Spotting</h2>
          <p>My third project on the course was done in a group. We were tasked with creating a fully RESTful web app using an Angular.JS front-end. As a team we came up with Film Spotting, a movie database, social media mashup to see what films the people you follow rate highly.</p>
          <p>Working in a group was challenging at first as we didn’t have as much freedom to code as we did with previous projects. However after learning to divide the work up and figuring out how to code in way we all agreed with, this project was really enjoyable and I’m proud of what our group was able to produce.</p>
          <p>Having the most experience with social media features from my previous project I focused mostly on those, implementing the following, likes and reviews, as well as writing the functions to populate the feed with content.</p>

          <h2>Fredstagram</h2>
          <p>For project 2 at General Assembly I was tasked with producing an Instagram clone. During the module leading up to this task we’d covered Node.JS, Express.JS and EJS so I started by using those to create a fully restful site for uploading photos.</p>
          <p>Once I was happy with that I started to work on registration and authentication. Then having reached a minimum viable product I spent the final few days working on more of the “Instagram like” features (likes, comments, following, etc).</p>
          <p>I was pleased with how much I was able to recreate with only a weeks experience with the chosen technologies and I’m happy with the finished product.</p>

          <h2>Jungle is Massive</h2>
          <p>Jungle is Massive is a turn based strategy game where two players choose and place troops on a battelfield and then fight it out to the last man standing.</p>
          <p>This was my first project at General Assembly. The brief for this project was to build a grid based game using JavaScript. I decided on my idea because I wanted my project to have an easily achievable M.V.P. but enough depth that I could keep adding features to it.</p>
          <p>Once I started coding I spent a long time working on how my grid was generated and how the game was setup to ensure that the fundamentals of the gameplay were solid before moving on.</p>
          <p>I then used the rest of the week I had for this project to add more features to it, to make gameplay more complex and varied, as well as adding animations and sounds to make the game feel more polished.</p>
